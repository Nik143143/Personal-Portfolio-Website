# To-Do List

This repository contains a simple and interactive **To-Do List** web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks, as well as clear all tasks at once. It features a modern, responsive design and intuitive user experience.

## Features

- Add new tasks with a single click
- Mark tasks as completed (with strikethrough effect)
- Delete individual tasks
- Clear all tasks with one button
- Responsive and visually appealing UI

## Folder Structure

```
practice_questions/To-Do-List/
├── index.html   # Main HTML file for the app UI
├── style.css    # CSS for layout and styling
└── app.js       # JavaScript for app logic and interactivity
```

## Environment & Configuration

- **Editor:** [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended for development and testing.
- **Live Server:** Use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in VS Code to run the app locally.
- **Port Configuration (Optional):** To specify a port for Live Server, add the following to your `.vscode/settings.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "liveServer.settings.port": 5501
  }
  ```

## How to Run

1. Open the `practice_questions/To-Do-List/` folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open `index.html`.
3. Right-click and select **"Open with Live Server"** (or open `index.html` directly in your browser).
4. Add, complete, and delete tasks as needed. Use the "Clear All" button to remove all tasks.

## Customization

- **Styling:** Modify `style.css` to change the appearance or layout.
- **Functionality:** Update `app.js` to add features such as task persistence, editing, or due dates.

## Dependencies
